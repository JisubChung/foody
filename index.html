              I grew up in the generation of Math Blaster and Reader Rabbit. DOS games were awesome and you had to “park” your hard drive to safely shut down your computer. My affinity for computers began as early as I could punch keys on the keyboard and see the letters pop up on the CRT monitor. I didn’t know how to type or code, but I saw my dad navigate through the hard drive and eventually was able to show off to my friends that I too could code by typing “dir” and list the current file directory tree - they were amazed.

              When I wasn’t playing DOS games, I’d be doodling my favorite cartoon characters like Ninja Turtles, Yoshi, and Pochacco. Growing up, my folks rarely bought us gaming consoles to play with. So sometimes, I’d cut out my drawings and tell my brother to say forward, back, attack to defeat the other character cut out in a little game of Super-Smash-Joon-Sub’s-Cut-Out-Characters – he was never able to defeat the last boss. As times advanced, my uncle showed me a picture of him posing on the highway next to his bike and another stunning image of my tiny cousins climbing up a cup he was holding - incredible, I thought! It took me a while to realize that there were photo-editing applications beyond MS Paint – namely, Photoshop.

              Shortly after, I was introduced to Macromedia Flash. By the way, I’m actually kinda sad Flash died but it was through its frame-by-frame animations and Actionscript language that ultimately got me into programming. I’ve won several international game and animation competitions that scored me several job opportunities that really expanded my love for programming day and night coding???. It was a love story too good to be true. In 2007, there were no App stores. The concept of app purchasing basically meant you were on your ISP’s mobile web portal to buy a JAVA game or was lucky enough to have a fun snake like game. ?? Frustrated, I switched to the web. I thought that surely apps would die out much like how Flash died out. I was wrong. Apps did survive, but what also came out of my frustration was my deep-rooted love for design and coding to combine in the form of front-end programming.
