Functions are king!
2. Style of coding:

Do everything with functions!

    input -> output

Not steps, but in terms of functions


//imperative
var name = "joon";
var gree = "hi, i'm ";

console.log(name + gree)

//functional
function greet(name) {
    console.log("hi, i'm " + name)
}

===================
Avoid side effects: use pure functions!

pure:
only returns

Use Higher order functions: functions that can be I/O

#Don't Iterate!
use map, reduce, filter
** know this!
    
Avoid mutability: use immutable 

Persistent data structures for efficient immutability
